      Ragging is a disturbing reality in the higher education system of our country. Despite the fact that over the years, ragging has claimed hundreds of innocent lives and has ruined the careers of thousands of bright students, the practice is still perceived by many as a way of ‘familiarisation’ and an ‘initiation into the real world’ for young college-going students.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
      Ragging is defined as any disorderly conduct, whether by words spoken or written or by an act, that has the effect of teasing, treating, or handling with rudeness a fresher or a junior student. It includes indulging in a rowdy or undisciplined activity that causes or is likely to cause annoyance, hardship, or psychological harm or to raise fear or apprehension thereof in a fresher or junior student. Asking students to do any act or perform something that they would not ordinarily do, and which causes or generates a sense of shame or embarrassment, adversely affecting the physique or psyche of a fresher or junior student, is also considered ragging. This can lead to adverse effects such as depression, anxiety, and sometimes even suicide.
